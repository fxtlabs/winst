quotes service.

WEBSITE
-------

Sidebar has 3 sections:

1. Description
2. Holdings - lists available months and years for holdings list
3. Realized gains - lists available years for realized gains list

Logo takes you to / (no sidebar)
Top tabs list available accounts; first tab is All

Buttonset right of top tabs selects reporting currency

Print uses its own CSS and hides logo, navigation menu, currency
buttonset, sidebar, and footer

WEBSITE 2
---------

Otherwise, there could be a sidebar with two sections:

top
  list of accounts

bottom
  list of years for the selected account
  (each year can be clicked or expanded to see a list of months)

The top of the page would have three tabs (activities, holdings, and
gains) and a toggle for the reporting currency (account currency or
CAD).

The page would keep state as you move around accounts, etc.
