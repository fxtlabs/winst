Notes
-----

NASDAQ keeps lists of the companies traded on the NASDAQ, NYSE, and
AMEX exchanges at http://www.nasdaq.com/screening/company-list.aspx.

These lists were downloaded as CSV files and stored in the
``resources`` directory under the project root.
They are used to look up the security name from its symbol and find
out on which exchange they are traded.
